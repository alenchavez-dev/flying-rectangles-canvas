# 🟨 Flying Rectangles (HTML5 Canvas Animation)  
**Author:** Alen Chavez

A tiny, single-file Canvas demo that spawns colored squares from the four corners of the screen and animates them with simple “bounce” physics using `requestAnimationFrame`. Great for showing comfort with the Canvas API, animation loops, and prototype-based objects.

## 🚀 Features
- HTML5 Canvas animation loop (`requestAnimationFrame`)
- Particle prototype with position, velocity, size, and random color
- Bounce off viewport edges (simple physics)
- Clean code comments and a visible header (title + author)

## 🧠 What This Demonstrates
- Canvas 2D rendering context
- Game-loop pattern (clear → draw → update → repeat)
- Basic collision with world bounds
- Organizing behavior with a simple object prototype + factory
